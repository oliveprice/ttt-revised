# ttt-revised

## Overview
This repository contains a static prototype of a Tic Tac Toe game. It's a non-functional, static site that serves as a visual to demonstrate the user interface and user experience design of the game. It is written purely in HTML, CSS, and JS.

## How It Works
Clicking the buttons regarding the decision of opponent/level of difficulty will begin the process. The prototype is structured like a slideshow to simulate the game flow. Navigation is facilitated through "next page" and "previous page" buttons, allowing users to move through the game sequence from start to finish. 

Please note that this is a static prototype: user choices do not influence the game's outcome or the flow of the prototype. Some buttons may have a **deliberate** delay before appearing to guide the user's attention following an event.


## Live Version
You can access the live version of the prototype here: https://654ae85dace39649ef5da4df--lovely-pastelito-d12001.netlify.app/index.html

## Running Locally
To run the prototype locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/oliveprice/ttt-revised.git
   
2. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory:
   ```sh
   cd ttt-revised

3. Since this is a static site, you can open the index.html file directly in your web browser.

Alternatively, if you want to run it using a local server:

For Node.js environments, you can use http-server or similar packages. If http-server is not installed, install it globally via npm. Then run the server in the project directory:
 ```sh
   npm install --global http-server
   http-server
